## Summary
Based on this analysis of the video game category, the data shows that Vine reviewers provide 5-star reviews at a higher rate than non-vine reviewers. However, more analysis would need to be undertaken before one could make a statement about bias in the Vine program. We would need to perform similar analyses across additional categories, not just a single category. Additionally we would need to perform statistical analysis to understand if the differences we see are statistically significant given the sample size.
